# Use this folder to write integration tests:

## Unit Tests: Test individual components or functions to ensure they work in isolation. Usually written for pure functions or small components.

## Integration Tests: Test multiple components or modules working together. This can involve testing how a form interacts with a state management library, for example.

## End-to-End (E2E) Tests: Simulate real user behavior to test the entire app. E2E tests are typically performed using tools like Cypress or Playwright and are often placed separately from other tests due to their focus on the full application behavior.
